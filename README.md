## Description

This module provides a set of tools, via CD4PE, for creating your own custom CD4PE deployment policies as well as our 4 built-in policies: [Feature branch](plans/feature_branch.pp), [Temporary branch](plans/rolling.pp), [Direct](plans/direct.pp), and [Eventual consistency](plans/eventual_consistency.pp).

## Usage

### Build your own policy

1. Get started with a custom deployment policy by creating a [Puppet Plan] in the `plans/` directory.
2. You'll have access to all of the functions listed in our [REFERENCE.md] to perform deployment operations (e.g. pinning nodes to an environment group or getting information about an environment group)
3. Deployment policies will run inside a CD4PE context with certain environment variables available.

   - `CD4PE_PIPELINE_ID`: NOT AVAILABLE IN MANUAL DEPLOYMENTS, a unique identifier for the current pipeline.
   - `MODULE_NAME`: the name of the module being deployed
   - `CONTROL_REPO_NAME`: the name of the control repo being deployed. In the case of a module feature branch deployment, this is the name of the control repo the deployment is based off of.
   - `BRANCH`: the name of the branch you are deploying _from_; your pipeline branch
   - `COMMIT`: HEAD commit SHA of the branch you are deploying from
   - `NODE_GROUP_ID`: alpha-numberic ID of the node group you are deploying _to_
   - `NODE_GROUP_ENVIRONMENT`:the environment of the node group you are deploying _to_
   - `REPO_TARGET_BRANCH`: name of the source control branch that represents the target environment
   - `ENVIRONMENT_PREFIX`: if you are deploying to a prefixed environment, this is that prefix
   - `REPO_TYPE`: will either be "CONTROL_REPO" or "MODULE"
   - `DEPLOYMENT_DOMAIN`: domain of the workspace that initiates the deployment
   - `DEPLOYMENT_ID`: unique ID of the deployment
   - `DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN`: the auth token that authenticates deployment tasks against CD4PE
   - `DEPLOYMENT_OWNER`: user that intitiates the deployment
   - Results - a set of variables will also be generated during the pipeline run to represent stage/event results, they have two parts:
     - `CD4PE_STAGE_<stage_number>_`: the variable name prefix with the stage number
     - `DEPLOYMENT_<deployment_number>_RESULT`, `JOB_<job_number>_RESULT`, `IMPACT_ANALYSIS_<analysis_number>_RESULT` : the task type with its sequence number.
     - Possible result values
       - `DONE`: task completed with no errors
       - `FAILED`: task failed
       - `CANCELED`: task was canceled either manually or because a preceding task failed
       - `DECLINED`: task was declined during the approval process
     - Examples:
       - The declined result of the first deployment in the second stage would be `CD4PE_STAGE_2_DEPLOYMENT_1_RESULT` with a value of `DECLINED`
       - The failure result of the third job in the first stage would be `CD4PE_STAGE_1_JOB_3_RESULT` with a value of `FAILED`
       - The success result of the first impact analysis in the third stage would be `CD4PE_STAGE_3_IMPACT_ANALYSIS_1_RESULT` with a value of `DONE`

4. Use any of the functions in this module (see [REFERENCE.md] to build your deployment policy.

   ```
   $result = get_node_group('abcd-1234-efgh-56789')

   if($result['error']){
     fail_plan("Could not get node group! ${result[error][message]}")
   }
   ```

5. Take a look at our [built-in policies](plans/) for examples to help you get started.

### Error handling

#### CD4PEFunctionResult

Most functions available in this module will always return a [CD4PEFunctionResult] that contains:

- result
- error: { message, code }

#### Example success result

```ruby
{
  result: {
    approvalDecision: "APPROVED"
  },
  error: nil
}
```

#### Example error result

```ruby
{
  result: nil,
  error: {
    message: "Something went wrong",
    code: "SomeErrorCode",
  }
}
```

#### Error Codes

- `ParameterMissing`
  - The CD4PE API was expecting a parameter that was not provided.
- `ParameterParsing`
  - The CD4PE API was unable to parse the provided parameter value.
- `FunctionFailure`
  - CD4PE was unable to complete the function's primary purpose (e.g. run_puppet() failed to run Puppet)
